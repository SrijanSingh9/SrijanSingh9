# Srijan Singh | Portfolio 🌟

Hey there! I'm Srijan Singh, a passionate B.TECH CSE student graduating in 2026. Welcome to my little corner of the web—a creative space where tech meets philosophy and every new day is a fresh adventure! ✨

## About Me

I love diving deep into new technologies and exploring innovative concepts. Rote learning might not be my thing, but I'm all about getting hands-on, experimenting, and making ideas come alive. When I'm not coding, you might catch me jamming to Indian classical tunes or traveling to serene spots across India—from the buzz of Delhi to the peaceful valleys of Uttarakhand. 🎶✈️
